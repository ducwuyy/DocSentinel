## [3.0.0] — 2026-03-12

### Major Change
This release transitions DocSentinel into a **pure Headless / MCP Service**. We have removed the built-in frontend to focus entirely on API and Agent integration capabilities.

### Removed
- **Frontend**: Removed the Streamlit dashboard, Assessment Workbench, and Knowledge Base Manager UI.
- **Dependencies**: Removed `streamlit`, `plotly`, `pandas`, and related UI assets.
- **Scripts**: Removed `generate_social_preview.py` and UI-related deployment configurations.

### Changed
- **Documentation**: Updated README to highlight MCP capabilities (Claude Desktop, Cursor, OpenClaw).
- **Deployment**: Simplified `docker-compose.yml` and `deploy.sh` to deploy only the backend service.
